# Server Configs

Many users asked about hosting their WSK-based apps and we thought we would
provide some boilerplate configurations for various web servers and other hosting
solutions.

[HTML5 Boilerplate project (H5BP)][9] already provides a number of useful configurations.
Those are linked as submodules in this directory.

We will try to reuse and contribute to as many OSS projects (like H5BP) as
we find to see fit Web Starter Kit.
